        <li>
          🎯 Eager to learn more about different tools and what makes them
          special to solve specific problems. Also, learn more about software
          architecture, design patterns, and best practices.

        <li>
          🤝 Open to collaborating on open-source or web-focused projects.

          🔍 Ask me about technical support, and web hosting, and how I apply
          that background to dev work.
