    <ul>
      <li>
        🏷️ I'm a full-stack developer who has worked with Astro.js, PHP and
        provided technical support for PHP-based websites.
      </li>
      <li>
        💻 Currently exploring Astro.js and React as a way to increase the
        amount of tools I work with. This allows me to deal with web application
        that requires lots of interaction and content-driven websites.
      </li>
      <li>
        🎯 Eager to learn more about different tools and what makes them special
        to solve specific problems. Also, learn more about software
        architecture, design patterns, and best practices.
      </li>
      <li>
        🏗️ Working on personal projects, and freelancing, to sharpen my web
        development skills.
      </li>
      <li>🤝 Open to collaborating on open-source or web-focused projects.</li>
      <li>
        🔍 Ask me about technical support, and web hosting, and how I apply that
        background to dev work.
