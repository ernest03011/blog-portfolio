Summary: Writing on a blog is a great way to share your knowledge, keep learning, improve your communication, and track your progress. Moreover, you can get similar results by exploring other alternatives, such as video content or a podcast.
<br/>
#### Contribute to others' journeys by sharing your knowledge
<br/>
Sharing your experience helps provide perspective about what being a software developer means. There are some common issues, such as how to approach learning, how to keep learning new technologies, how to choose a path, and the list goes on. These kinds of insights allow others to navigate the challenges and become better professionals.
<br/>
We could get caught up in how much value sharing my experience can provide, and the short answer is "a lot". There is always someone more or less advanced on the career journey, and that is a fact. But the trajectory is not the same, and that is why there is always some unique value to provide.
<br/>
<br/>
#### Writing about new technologies
<br/>
Having new tools, new frameworks, or a new programming language is part of the deal. It is part of being a Software Developer, and one of the reasons to keep learning. Sometimes, it is not a new tool, but you want to tinker with it, you want to expose yourself to it. Moreover, doing so is part of the growth and improving your skills. When you get to do that and then write about it, that is a great recipe to solidify your knowledge. A great way to check how much you understand that tool or describe the experience of using it.
<br/>
<br/>
#### Enhancing communication skills
<br/>
The process of creating these posts will help you improve your writing skills and organize your thoughts. The first draft would not make so much sense. The second draft might be clearer. And even after that, you might have a forty-word sentence which is hard to read.
<br/>
Also, you might not be writing in your native language, which adds more complexity. However, it also provides the condition for you to practice those communication skills. A great way to get better at communicating technical stuff to non-technical stakeholders.  In short, it can be a learning opportunity.
<br/>
<br/>
#### Tracking Your Growth
<br/>
Creating posts provides a way to document your journey and summarize what you have learned. This is useful if you need to revisit this content later on in a career that requires you to keep learning. Moreover, these posts are like logs that you could analyze and reflect on. This self-evaluation adds a healthy dosage of perspective when, or if, you get to deal with impostor syndrome. 
<br/>
<br/>
#### Beyond Blogging and Writing: Alternative Approaches
<br/>
You can achieve almost everything I've mentioned so far in other ways, such as video content or a podcast. For example, your background might allow you to share your knowledge using other alternatives. And, in a way that is easier and more comfortable for you. Anyway, you know best, make sure you find your way to share your knowledge, keep learning, and keep building.
