GitHub actions are like tasks that are usually created in the context of CI/CD. These tasks are usually triggered when certain actions are detected, such as pushing or a pull request to a bran on a git repository.

<br />
These tasks can help in different ways like checking the security in your
codebase, checking for code quality, optimization (like optimizing images) or
deploying your website to a server.
<br />
I enrolled in this course with low expectations, since I was not familiar with
it and just wanted to learn something. After the second class I started to get a
better understanding of the impact that it has when it comes to dealing with
codebases, especially with big ones where quality, and security are a must.
<br />
It allows adding a layer to double-check the code that is going to production,
do it automatically, and even notifying the stakeholders in case that something
goes wrong.
<br />
There are lots of use cases, some templates can be found on GitHub so you can
augment your action or the template could be all you need.
<br />
Some developers (depending on the company or the team) might not deal with
GitHub actions, however, it is good to be familiar with them (GitHub environment
in general) and even use these actions on personal projects to make sure that
quality and security are guaranteed.
