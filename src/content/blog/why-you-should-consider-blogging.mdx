Blogging is a way to share your perspective, knowledge and experience which can be pretty valuable at the very least to one persona, and it also helps you learn and become a better at your career for example.

<br />
I heard recently that “no matter how far on your journey you are, there would be
people that are more or less advance than you on that path”, and in addition to
that, I would add that we all have different experiences, personalities,
talents, etc., and I say all of that to say that we all have some value to
contribute.
<br />
Going beyond blogging, or putting it in another way, writing is the key part
about this and how it helps organize our thoughts, challenge how much we
understand something, a way to relive certain moments and so on. In short,
“writing is something worth considering”.
<br />
And if you want more reasons about why you could consider it, ask ChatGPT to
provide some benefits of blogging/writing.
